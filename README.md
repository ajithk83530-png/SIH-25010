## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
We propose an AI-powered Smart Irrigation System that uses soil moisture sensors, weather data, and crop type information to optimize water usage in agriculture. The system will automatically regulate water supply through IoT-enabled pumps 
Farmers often waste water due to traditional irrigation practices. This solution reduces water consumption, improves crop yield, and ensures sustainable farming.
Innovation and uniqueness:
Unlike normal drip irrigation, this system integrates real-time weather forecasting + AI-based decision-making to predict water requirements, making it more efficient and cost-effective.


## Technical Approach
Technologies to be used:
IoT sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity), Arduino/Raspberry Pi controllers, Cloud-based AI model for decision-making, Mobile app for farmer notifications.
Methodology and process for implementation:
Install soil sensors and connect them to IoT device.
Collect data (soil moisture, temperature, weather).
AI model analyzes water need for specific crop.
IoT-enabled pump automatically irrigates as per requirement.
Farmer can monitor and control via mobile application.


## Feasibility and Viability
Analysis of feasibility:
The system uses low-cost sensors and microcontrollers, making it affordable for small and medium farmers. Cloud-based AI ensures scalability across regions.
Potential challenges and risks:
Initial installation cost may be a concern.
Requires basic training for farmers to use the mobile app.
Internet connectivity in rural areas may affect performance (can be solved using offline edge computing).


## Impact and Benefits
Economic Benefits:
Farmers save money by reducing water and electricity usage.
Higher crop yield leads to better income.

Environmental Benefits:
Saves up to 40–50% water compared to traditional irrigation.
Promotes sustainable farming and reduces groundwater depletion.

Social Benefits:
Improves quality of life for farmers by reducing manual effort.
Encourages adoption of technology in rural areas.

Scalability and Long-term Impact:
Can be extended to multiple crops and regions.
Supports government initiatives in Digital Agriculture and Smart Village Development
